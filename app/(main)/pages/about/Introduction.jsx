          At our core, we are committed to reducing food waste, alleviating hunger, and fostering sustainability.
          Every year, billions of pounds of edible food are discarded while millions of people go without. Our mission is to change that. We rescue surplus food from farms, grocery stores, restaurants, manufacturers, and even from individual householdsâ€”preventing it from ending up in landfills and causing unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions. This food is then repurposed and redistributed to individuals and families in need, offering them access to fresh, healthy, and nutritious meals.
